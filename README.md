<b>Roll Jump Fall</b> was originally created for learning purposes.
It started as a simple project to teach my friend how to make a game in Unity. It was a great experience for both of us, me as the teacher and my friend as the learner.
This version of the game is fully made by me. I used it as an example project to demonstrate mechanics that he could later try to implement on his own.
